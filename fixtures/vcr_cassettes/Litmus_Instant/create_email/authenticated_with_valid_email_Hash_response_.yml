You can find your key, or generate a new one, here: https://litmus.com/api-key. If your API requests were previously working, check to make sure someone hasn't generated a new API key, thereby invalidating the older one. If you're stuck, please reach out at hello@litmus.com and we'll have a Support Engineer reach out as soon as possible."
